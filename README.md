# ApexAlerts

### Description

I love Apex Legends and I always loved the animation that would come up when you won a round.  I also have a few streamers that I watch regularly that stream the game.  Those two facts made me attempt to recreate some of the animations to be used as Twitch alerts for new followers and subs and things like that.  I intend to do a number of these for different elements of the game.

### Issues I've Encountered (since I started on 07/19)

I simply can't figure out how to do the shimmer/sheen effect.  Even googling examples I can't make it work.  Clearly, something isn't clicking with me and it's gotten me frustrated enough that I'm putting down the project for now.

The large blue glowing effects in the background.  Just like the previously mentioned effect, I can't make anything work the way I want it to.

### My Environment

This was designed to work with a 1280x720 canvas.
I have some things in pixels and others in percentages.
I use VSCode and SASS for my CSS.
Yes, I have multiple CSS files as I have a tendancy to butcher and break my code requiring me to start over.
Yes, that previous statement does mean that I have no idea how to use git.  I'll get there eventually.
