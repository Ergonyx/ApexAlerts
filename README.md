ApexAlerts
I love Apex Legends and I always loved the animation that would come up when you won a round.  I also have a few streamers that I watch regularly that stream the game.  Those two facts made me attempt to create some of the animations to be used as Twitch alerts for new followers and subs and things like that.

I intend to do a number of these for different elements of the game.
